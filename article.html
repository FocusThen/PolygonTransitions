  <p>Do you love triangles? i do. And because its boring to like all the triangles, i specifically target my love on equilateral ones, like this one:</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="media/triangle.png" alt="equilateral triangle">
    <figcaption>
        isn't it beautiful? üòç
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <h2>Why</h2>  
  <p>Nobody:<br>
  Nobody at all:<br>
  Me: lets make full screen image transitions with equilateral triangles!</p>
  <p>And although that pretty much sums up the reasoning part, i also did this for the love. For the love of equilateral triangles.</p>
  
  <p>So lets get started! Just as i did in <a href='https://tympanus.net/codrops/2019/11/05/creative-webgl-image-transitions/'>my previous animations</a>>, i will need some plane geometry in front of a viewer.</p>
  <p>But if i use three.js PlaneBufferGeometry</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="media/plane.png" alt="triangle strip">
    <figcaption>
        Not epic. Boring triangles.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Those are not the triangles we are looking for. To create equilateral ones, i just created my geometry with math! The final result looks like this:</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="media/equi.png" alt="equilateral triangle strip">
    <figcaption>
        Woah, now this is pure beauty. Don't judge me.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>What's the math behind that? Pretty easy actually, with equilateral triangle you know exactly all the coordinates and sizes:</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="media/math.png" alt="equilateral triangle math">
    <figcaption>
       Math.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Knowing those sizes, i can easily calculate as many trianges as i need. Also, i cant help sharing this <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/">amazing resource on all kinds of hexagonal and equilateral triangle grids</a> . Thats an amazing read regargless of your geometric preferences.</p>

  <p>Anyhow, i got this kind of grid:</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="media/equifull.png" alt="equilateral triangle strip">
    <figcaption>
        I scaled that to fit the whole screen.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h2>Next step: animating</h2>
  <p>Now that we have grid, we can use GLSL and vertex shader to animate those triangles. I advise you to read more about shaders and GLSL in "<a href="https://thebookofshaders.com/">The Book Of Shaders</a>".</p>
  <p>The good news is that we can animate each triangle separately, we can even animate each of his vertices on their own!</p>

    <figcaption>
        Example of animation
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>In code that looks like:</p>
  <pre class="brush:glsl">
vec3 newPosition = move(position, progress);
  </pre>
  <p>Where <code>move</code> function moves and rotates default position with the change of progress value. That could be simple shift on X-axis, for example:</p>
  <pre class="brush:glsl">
vec3 newPosition = position + progress*vec3(1.,0.,0.);
</pre>
  <p>Or anything you could imagine doing with numbers.<br>
  I had a lot of fun experimenting with those effects, hope you will like them. And the possibilities here are endless of course.</p>
  <p>Tell me, or better show me, what geometry figures do you like to animate? =)</p>
  <p>P.S.: i do love all the triangles, i hope no triangles will get offended or mad after reading this article. </p>

  <p>Do you like unrolling things? Or may be you prefer rolling them in?</p>
  <p>I spent my childhood doing crepes. I loved those rolles.</p>
  <figure>
      <img src="assets/roll.jpg" alt="rolled crepes">
  </figure>
  <p>I guess, the time has come to unroll all the things. And to unroll as many rolls as possible i decided to automate this process with a bit of JS and WebGL. </p>
  
  <h2>Set Up</h2>
  <p>I will be using THREE.js for this animation, and set up a basic scene with some planes.<br>
  Just as in <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/2019/12/16/scroll-refraction-and-shader-effects-in-three-js-and-react/">this tutorial</a> by Paul Henschel we will replace all the images with those PlaneGeometry objects. So with this html in mind:</p>
  <pre class="brush:html">
  &lt;img src=&ldquo;owl.jpg&rdquo; class=&ldquo;js-image&gt;
  </pre>
  Once the page loads i will hide them:
  <pre class="brush:css">
  .js-image{opacity:0}
  </pre>
  <p>Then i will get dimensions and sizes of each image and position my 3D Planes exactly in place of each DOM image element.</p>
  <pre class="brush:js">
  MY_SCENE.add(
      new THREE.Mesh(
          new PlaneGeometry(640,480),  // some size of image
          new Material({texture:‚Äôowl.jpg‚Äô) // texture i took from DOM
      )
  )
  </pre>
  <p>Because rolling things with CSS or SVG is next to impossible, i needed all the power of WebGL, and i moved parts of my page into that world. But i like the idea of progressive enhancement, so we still have the usual images there in code, and if 3d is not working, user would just see them.</p>
  
  <p>After that, its quite easy to sync the scroll of the page with my 3D scene position. For that i used custom  smooth scroll described in <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/2019/07/10/how-to-add-smooth-scrolling-with-inner-image-animations-to-a-web-page/">amazing tutorial</a> by Mary Lou.  You should definitely check it out, as it works regardless of platform and actions that you use to scroll. You know this is usually the biggest pain with custom scrolling libraries.</p>
  
  <h1>Roll</h1>
  <p>So, we have it in 3D! Now with power of shaders we can do anything!<br>
  Well, anything <em>we</em> are capable of, at least =).</p>
  <figure>
      <video src="assets/wireframe.mp4" muted autoplay loop width="600"></video>
      <figcaption>
          Red parts are WebGL, everything else HTML.
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>I started from the end. I imagine every animation i do, as some function which takes number between 0 and 1 (i call it `progress`), and returns visual. So result of my imaginary RollFunction(0), should be something rolled. And RollFunction(1), should be just the default position of the plane.
  That‚Äôs how i got the last line of my animation:</p>
  <pre class="brush:glsl">
  vec3 finalPosition = mix(RolledPosition, DefaultPosition,progress);
  </pre>
  <p>I had DefaultPosition from the start, its usually called `position` (surprise). So all i needed, to create this RolledPosition, and change my progress!</p>
  
  <p>I figured a couple of ways to do that. I could have had another object(like an .obj file) done in some editor, or even fully exported animation from Blender or other program. <br>
  But i decided to transform DefaultPosition into RolledPosition with a couple of math functions inside my Vertex shader. So, imagine we have a plane lying in Z plane, so,  to roll something like that, you could do this:<p>
  
  <pre class="brush:glsl">
  RolledPosition.x = RADIUS*cos(position.x);
  RolledPosition.y = position.y; // stays the same
  RolledPosition.z = RADIUS*sin(position.x);
  </pre>
  
  <p>If you ever tried to draw circle yourself, you can easily guess where its coming from.  If not here is a famous GIF illustrating how it's all related:</p>
  <figure>
      <img src="assets/sine.gif" alt="sine + cosine = circle">
      <figcaption>
          See how those two functions are essentially part of circle.
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <p>Of course this would just make a (not so) perfect tube out of our plane, but just adding a couple of parameters here, can make it a real roll:</p>
  
  <pre class="brush:glsl">
  RADIUS *= 1 - position.x; // so it gets smaller when we roll plane
  newposition.z =  RADIUS*sin(position.x*TWO_PI);
  newposition.x =  RADIUS*cos(position.x*TWO_PI); 
  </pre>
  
  <p>And you will get something like that:</p>
  <figure>
  <iframe height="234" style="width: 100%;" scrolling="no" title="Archimedean spiral unroll animation" src="https://codepen.io/claimred/embed/JNZPPJ?height=234&theme-id=default&default-tab=js,result" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">
    See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/claimred/pen/JNZPPJ'>Archimedean spiral unroll animation</a> by Ted
    (<a href='https://codepen.io/claimred'>@claimred</a>) on <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
  </iframe>
      <figcaption>
          It is done with the help of D3 library, but idea is the same.
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>This two-dimensional animation has really helped me to get the idea of rolling things. So i recommend you to dig into the code, its quite interesting!</p>
  
  <p>After that step, it was a matter of time and arithmetics to play a bit with progress, so i have this kind of animation for my plane:</p>
  <video src="assets/final.mp4" muted loop autoplay></video>
  <p>There are a number of other steps, to make angle parametric, and to make it a bit more beautiful with subtle shadows, but thats the most important part right here. Sine and Cosine functions are often at the core of all the cool things you see on the web! =).</p>
  
  <p>So let me know, do you like these rolls, and how much time have you spent scrolling it back and forth just to see ‚Äòem roll! Have a nice day! =)</p>
